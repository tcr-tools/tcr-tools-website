Now that you have the mental model, where should you go?

- **"I want to see real code."** -> Check out `Coming Soon: Guides`.
- **"I want the API details."** -> Check out `Coming Soon: Reference`.
- **"I want to see the Studio."** -> [Studio](/studio).
- **"I'm ready to install."** -> [Installation](/docs/installation).
